    <h1>Spicy Chicken Noodles</h1>

    <p><strong> 
        No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy chicken noodles dish is perfect for using up leftover chicken,<br> 
         assuming it wasn't horribly overcooked in the first place. If you did want to use raw chicken, go ahead and chop it up, and stir-fry it for a minute or two before<br> 
         adding your vegetables.
