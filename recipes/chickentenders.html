    <h1>Chicken Tenders</h1>  
    <img src="images/chickentenders.jpg" alt="Fingerliking good chicken tenders"> 
    <p><strong> 
    These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying!<br> 
    You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.
    </strong></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul> 
    <li>cooking spray</li> 
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 Â¼ cups panko bread crumbs</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Steps</h2> 
<ol> 
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li> 
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>

        Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
    <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
    <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more.<br>

    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li> 
    <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
